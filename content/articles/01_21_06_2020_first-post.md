## Hello, there!

Welcome to my personal website. 

This website will be mainly filled with small tutorials, based on my old/new experiences. This tutorials will be an in depth explanations of the things I learned, did, learn and do.

Everything that is found here, is entirely based on my experiences. I will try to keep posting regularly, but I don't make any commitments or promisees.

I will try to build up a small series of tutorials where I will explain why I built up my own static site generator and how I did it, and maybe meanwhile improve the functionalities of this one.

Have fun exploring the website and feel free to [contact me](/contact). Currently the contact page is not fully working, as I would like to prepare a small tutorial on what I am doing there.

Enjoy life and always be curios.
