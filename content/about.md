## Hello!

I'm Flavius, a fullstack developer with focus on backend, based in MÃ¼nchen, Germany. I have been in the field nearly 10 years and I enjoyed every minute of it.

I love to craft digital experiences, with the help of the newest technology available. 

During my work experience I have worked from simple projects, like presentation website, up to complex projects, like custom e-commerce platform or user management platforms.

Currently I am a backend developer at [thinxnet.com](//thinxnet.com), where I try to craft the best solutions with the best technologies.

Among my skill set can be found:

* Javascript/ES6/Nodejs/Express/Mongoose
* MongoDB/Kafka/API-Gateway/postgresql
* Mocha/Chai/Sinon
* Python/Bash
* HTML5/CSS3/Vuejs
